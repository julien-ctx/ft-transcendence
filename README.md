# Transcendence: An Online Pong Game From Scratch | 42

## Overview

In this project, we set up a multiplayer game site in its entirety in order to play Pong on a network.

The site was built with **NestJS** for the backend, and **SvelteJS** for the frontend. Many features have also been implemented:

- Authentication and storage of users in PostgreSQL database.
- Privacy settings: two-factor authentication, user blocking...
- Direct messages and instant chat channels.
- Real-time responsive Pong game in a canvas.
- Ranking system, friends, and invitation notifications.
- Responsive single page application with dynamic content update.
